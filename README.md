# Things to clean or fix:
- add loading state when doing api calls
- get auth with context
- make special hook to fetch data
- make special hook for localstorage
- need to find solution for creating post speed


# Features that could be added in the future
- Feat: add user on top of the post
- Feat: update user
- Feat: update post
- Feat: profile image user
- Feat: show user likes (ethical responsible ?)
- Fix: make db collection of likes so you can see who liked the post (this is now in localstorage so in other browser will be a different result)

Extra extra feature: adding followers => change to cassandra database ?
